            What is your attraction?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">
            Grim Trails is an award-winning fairy-tale and folklore themed
            haunted trail with scenes woven throughout small buildings and
            woods. Don’t believe us? Check out our preview video!
          </p>

          <h2 class="faq__question">
            What age groups are appropriate?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">
            While we believe Halloween is for everyone, we do not recommend our
            haunted trail for children under 10 due to the fright factor.
            Children under the age of 10 will receive the same terrifying show
            as any other patron for the same price.
          </p>

          <h2 class="faq__question">
            Will the monsters touch me?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">
            Our haunted house has a no-touch policy- our actors and staff will
            not touch you, and customers are not allowed to touch us. Due to
            low-light conditions and narrow passages, our monsters may bump into
            you. Our creatures will not push, grab or maul you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="faq__question">
            Does your haunted house have security?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">
            Yes! We value the safety of our staff and guests. We have LMPD
            officers present at all times when the attraction is open.
          </p>

          <h2 class="faq__question">
            Is it different from last year?
          </h2>
          <p class="faq__answer">
            During the ten months of the year that we are closed, we endlessly
            renovate and add new scenes designed to scare and excite. Follow us
            on Facebook and Instagram for sneak peeks of everything we’re
            dishing up this year.

            If I get too scared and have to leave through an emergency exit, do
