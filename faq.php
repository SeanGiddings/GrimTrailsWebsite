		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What is your attraction?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Grim Trails is an award-winning fairy-tale and folklore themed
			haunted trail with scenes woven throughout small buildings and
			woods. Donâ€™t believe us? Check out our preview video!
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What age groups are appropriate?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
		  While we believe Halloween is for everyone, we do not recommend our haunted trail for children under 10 due to 
		  the fright factor. Children under the age of 10 will receive the same terrifying show as any other patron for the same price. 
		  No strollers will be permitted into the attraction. Guests under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult. 
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Will the monsters touch me?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Our haunted house has a no-touch policy- our actors and staff will
			not touch you, and customers are not allowed to touch us. Due to
			low-light conditions and narrow passages, our monsters may bump into
			you. Our creatures will not push, grab or maul you.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Does your haunted house have security?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Yes! All guests must pass through a walkthrough metal detector for the safety of our staff and guests. We also have security present at all times when the attraction is open.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What Items Are Not Allowed Inside?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
		  No weapons of any kind, lighters, matches, e-cigarettes, backpacks, umbrellas, purses larger than 12"x12", beverages, cameras, photography equipment. 
		  Halloween masks or costumes will not be permitted. Bags and purses will be subject to search. 
		  Any guest in a costume or Halloween mask will be asked to leave.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Is it different from last year?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Absolutely! As the longest walkthrough attraction in Louisville, we're continually revamping and adding to our 1/2 mile-long trail. 
			Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GrimTrails/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grimtrails" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for sneak peeks of everything we're dishing up this year.

		  We accept cash, Visa, Mastercard and Discover. 
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Is it really Scary?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			We certainly hope so!
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			If I get too scared and have to leave through an emergency exit, do
			I get a refund?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			No.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Do you use strobe lights?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Yes. We use strobe lights, fog, snow and laser machines.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Should I wear sandals?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Grim Trails is an outdoor haunt, so closed-toed shoes are recommended. You might encounter roots, rocks, or muddy conditions!
		  </p>
