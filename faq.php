		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What is your attraction?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Grim Trails is an award-winning fairy-tale and folklore themed
			haunted trail with scenes woven throughout small buildings and
			woods. Donâ€™t believe us? Check out our preview video!
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What age groups are appropriate?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			While we believe Halloween is for everyone, we do not recommend our
			haunted trail for children under 10 due to the fright factor.
			Children under the age of 10 will receive the same terrifying show
			as any other patron for the same price. No strollers will be permitted into the attraction.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Will the monsters touch me?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Our haunted house has a no-touch policy- our actors and staff will
			not touch you, and customers are not allowed to touch us. Due to
			low-light conditions and narrow passages, our monsters may bump into
			you. Our creatures will not push, grab or maul you.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Does your haunted house have security?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Yes! All guests must pass through a walkthrough metal detector for the safety of our staff and guests. We also have security present at all times when the attraction is open.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What Items Are Not Allowed Inside?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
		  No weapons of any kind, lighters, matches, e-cigarettes, backpacks, umbrellas, purses larger than 12"x12", beverages, cameras, photography equipment. 
		  Halloween masks or costumes will not be permitted. Bags and purses will be subject to search. 
		  Any guest in a costume or Halloween mask will be asked to leave.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Is it different from last year?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
		  Absolutely! Our 2022 trail is in an all-new location, with a brand-new trail, layout, 
		  and a never-before-seen selection of scenes designed to scare and excite. 
		  Follow us on Facebook and Instagram for sneak peeks of everything we're dishing up this year.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			What form of payment do you accept
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
		  We accept cash, Visa, Mastercard and Discover. 
		  We also have an ATM on site for your convenience.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Is it really Scary?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			We certainly hope so!
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			If I get too scared and have to leave through an emergency exit, do
			I get a refund?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			No.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Do you use strobe lights?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Yes. We use strobe lights, fog, snow and laser machines.
		  </p>

		  <h2 class="faq__question">
			Should I wear sandals?
		  </h2>
		  <p class="faq__answer">
			Grim Trails is an outdoor haunt, so closed-toed shoes are recommended. You might encounter roots, rocks, or muddy conditions!
